## Notebooks Overview

Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of sea surface temperature data:

### Introduction to SST

This notebook provides an overview of sea surface temperature, its importance, and how OSI SAF products are generated. It serves as a starting point for understanding the subsequent notebooks.

### Data Processing

In this notebook, you will learn how to process raw SST data. It covers data cleaning, filtering, and preparation techniques. You will also explore how to handle missing data.

### Visualization Techniques

Visualizing SST data is crucial for interpretation. This notebook demonstrates various visualization techniques, including contour plots, time series, and heatmaps. You will learn how to create informative graphics using Python libraries.

### Applications in Marine Science

This notebook discusses real-world applications of SST data in marine science. It covers topics such as ocean circulation, weather patterns, and their implications for marine ecosystems.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can set up your environment as follows:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Qcon555/learn-osi-saf-sst.git
   cd learn-osi-saf-sst
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
